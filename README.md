# README #

This repository contains base files for your work. You can expect to get several updates from the lecturer as the course progresses.

### Why do we need versioning? ###
* Commit and push all of the code you write regularly. This will have multiple benefits.
** It will act as a backup of your work in case you accidentally delete something.
** It will act as a backup of your work in case your SD-card gets corrupted.
** It will act as a backup of your work in case you brake any of the functionality that worked well last time.
* It will be used to track your progress throughout the course.

### What do I need to keep in mind? ###
* You can not commit code straight on to the master branch. You will use student/your-name branch to commit and push all of your code. If you have more than two names use your first and last name.
* Create a Pull Request (PR) at the end of each session. You have to do this even if you do not complete the whole lab in one sitting.
* Keep your repository tidy.
** Use a uniform naming scheme for files and functions. You have to be able to find your solution by just knowing the lab and task number!
** Do not commit large binary files.
* Reuse functions you have already developed. Use them by importing code from previous weeks or by making a copy of the functions.
* **Make sure you reserve a copy of all tasks implementations for the oral examination!**
